** API Gateway
- Ion Web Handler
  - Follows the Ring Spec! Reuse your existing Apps!
  - This also means its possible to use pedestal with Ions

** Lambda
- Ion Handler
  - IMO replaces cljs-lambda
  - Yes, JVM startup time. Its a Shim though, and is an implementation
    detail, not a requirement
  - Its your responsibility to adhere to the api that the calling service
    expects. In practice this seems pretty straight forward.
  - Integrates with any other service in the AWS cloud.
    - Kinesis
    - S3
    - SQS
    - SNS
    - Anything that can fire a lambda function can fire an Ion.
